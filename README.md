# Kickstart that sh*t!

Personal list of must-have packets, scripts that i am sick and tired of re-installing.

## Running
*Do you trust me enough to run as root?*

```
 sudo sh kickstart.sh
 ```

## Logic

Sequence of steps that this magnificent bastard takes:

1. installs all packages from 'packages' file
2. initiates all '*.sh' files in 'scripts' directory
3. ???
4. profit.

### Enjoy!
